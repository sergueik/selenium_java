# Spring MVC WebFlux API Builder

Source mapping: Tier 1 critical skill derived from `Kotlin_Spring_Developer_Pipeline.md` (`SK-06`).

## Mission

Produce API code that is not only plausible but correct for the repository's actual Spring stack.
Generate endpoints, DTOs, validation, and test scaffolding as one coherent unit.

## Decide The Stack First

- Verify whether the module is Spring MVC or WebFlux.
- Verify whether controllers are blocking, coroutine-based, or Reactor-based.
- Verify the project's existing error format, serialization rules, and OpenAPI approach.
- Reuse `project-context-ingestion` output if it already established these facts.

## Design The Contract Before Writing Code

- Define the endpoint path, method, authentication expectation, idempotency rule, and status codes.
- Define request and response DTO boundaries. Do not expose entities directly.
- Define the error model for validation failures, business conflicts, not found, and unexpected errors.
- Define pagination, sorting, and correlation-id behavior if applicable.
- Define whether null, missing, and defaulted fields have distinct semantics.

## Generate In This Order

1. Request and response DTOs.
2. Validation annotations with correct Kotlin `@field:` use-site targets.
3. Controller signature.
4. Service interface or use-case boundary.
5. Mapping or translation code between transport and domain models.
6. Error handling via `@ControllerAdvice` or the project's equivalent.
7. One focused web-layer test proving the contract.

## Kotlin-Specific Rules

- Use `@field:` targets for Jakarta Bean Validation annotations on constructor properties.
- Be explicit about nullable versus required fields.
- Treat `null` versus absent as a contract decision, especially for PATCH-like behavior.
- Verify `jackson-module-kotlin` or equivalent serialization support before relying on Kotlin constructor defaults.
- Prefer immutable DTOs with `val` properties unless the project clearly uses a different pattern.

## MVC And WebFlux Rules

- Do not mix MVC and WebFlux styles in the same generated endpoint unless the repository already does so intentionally.
- For MVC, prefer ordinary return types and blocking service boundaries.
- For WebFlux with coroutines, prefer `suspend` functions and `Flow<T>` when streaming is required.
- For Reactor-based code, follow the project's existing `Mono` and `Flux` conventions instead of inventing a hybrid style.

## Advanced Contract Decisions

- Prefer stable machine-readable error codes in the payload even when human-readable messages change.
- Choose `400` versus `422` deliberately. Validation and malformed input are not the same as a domain rule violation.
- For create endpoints, decide whether `201 Created` plus `Location` is part of the contract. Do not default to `200` just because it is easy.
- For update endpoints, consider optimistic concurrency signals such as version fields or `ETag` and `If-Match` when concurrent edits matter.
- For PATCH semantics, model three states explicitly when needed: absent, present with value, and present with null. Plain nullable Kotlin fields do not always represent all three.
- Avoid exposing Spring-specific transport types like `Page` directly as the public API contract unless the service already standardized on that decision.
- Be explicit about date-time, enum, and value-class serialization. Default serializer behavior often drifts across versions and clients.
- In streaming endpoints, consider cancellation, backpressure, and partial-write behavior, not only the method signature.

## Expert Heuristics

- Design the error contract and validation contract before controller code. Retrofitting them later causes the most API churn.
- Keep transport DTOs narrow and explicit. Reusing internal domain models usually saves time once and costs time forever.
- If the service is public or long-lived, optimize for backward-compatible contract evolution: additive fields, stable codes, and deliberate deprecations.
- Put correlation-id propagation in filters or interceptors when possible, not in every controller method.

## Output Contract

Return either a ready-to-apply patch plan or concrete files or code blocks containing:

- request DTO
- response DTO
- controller
- service interface or use-case entry point
- exception mapping or advice updates
- web-layer test

Also return a short explanation of the API contract decisions that materially affect compatibility.

## Guardrails

- Do not leak internal exception details in API errors.
- Do not use validation annotations on the wrong target in Kotlin.
- Do not expose persistence entities on the wire.
- Do not assume default HTTP codes without checking the contract.
- Do not silently pick MVC when the module is WebFlux, or the reverse.

## Verification Checklist

- The endpoint compiles against the actual Spring stack in the repository.
- Validation triggers for invalid input and returns the expected error shape.
- Success and at least one failure path are covered by a web-layer test.
- Serialization rules match the existing project conventions.

## Quality Bar

A good run of this skill gives the user an endpoint that compiles, validates, serializes, and fails consistently.
A bad run mixes frameworks, gets Kotlin validation wrong, or invents an error model that the rest of the service does not use.
