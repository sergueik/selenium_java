* In most cases, pull requests for bug fixes and new features should be based on the `main` branch.
* It is important to write a good commit message explaining why the feature is needed.
* Write a test case before fixing the bug or new feature (not mandatory).
* Make sure the patch does not break backward compatibility.
* Make sure existing test cases don’t fail.
